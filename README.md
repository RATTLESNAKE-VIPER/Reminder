Reminder
--------
Reminders is a great android app to help keep things organized throughout the day as it allows to setup reminders based on location. For example, location-based Reminders can help you remember to call someone or do the laundry when you get to a specific location.

Reminders will start notifying you when you have arrived at, or left, the specified location. A handy feature for the busy smartphone user thatâ€™s always on the go.
